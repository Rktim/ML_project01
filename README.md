Task 1 : House Price Prediction Model

Project Description
This project aims to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. By leveraging a linear regression model, we can provide accurate price predictions and insights into the housing market.

Key Features of the Project:
Data Loading and Preparation:

The housing data is loaded from a CSV file.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Data Visualization:

Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with house prices.
This helps in identifying trends and patterns within the data.
Model Training:

A linear regression model is trained using the training dataset.
The training process involves fitting the model to understand how features like square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms impact house prices.
Prediction:

The trained model is used to predict house prices on the testing dataset.
This step helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
Model Evaluation:

The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics:
R2 Score: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squares of the errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of the squared errors, providing an indication of the model's prediction error magnitude.
Model Insights:

The model coefficients (weights for each feature) and intercept are displayed, providing insights into the influence of each feature on house prices.

Key Points
Linear Regression Application: Demonstrates the practical application of linear regression for predicting house prices.
Python Libraries Used: Utilizes powerful libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and scikit-learn for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.
Step-by-Step Explanation: Offers a clear and concise explanation of each step involved in the modeling process, making it accessible and understandable.
Adaptability: The project can be easily replicated and adapted to other datasets, allowing for flexibility in various predictive modeling scenarios.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting house prices using linear regression. By following the steps outlined, you will gain a deeper understanding of the modeling process and the factors that influence housing prices. Feel free to explore and modify the project to suit your needs and datasets.
